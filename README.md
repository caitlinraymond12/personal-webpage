# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this website
This website was created by me as a way to experiment with web developement as well as make something useful that can tell people more about me. The project in total took about three weeks, and I started with zero knowledge about CSS, HTML, and React with Javascript. The first week was focused on learning the basics of all three languages, and the next two weeks were about actually creating the website, pushing projects to github, and publishing my games to itch.io. 

Thank you for reading, I hope you learned a little more about me!


## References
 The majority of the code for my website is my own, as the purpose of this was to learn React myself. I watched many youtube tutorials and read many websites when trying to figure out difficult parts, so a few snippets of code can be traced back to Net Ninja's youtube channel, and W3Schools.com. The CSS styling for the moon and the sun when switching between light and dark mode was taken from this blog, detailing different button styles: https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/toggle-switch-css/.
